        why is this website so simple?: <br>
        - i made this for the sake of having a website. there's no need to learn any web frameworks
        or complicate things when i just want to have a place to put words on the internet <br>
        - some modern websites sort of lack personality and focus too hard on "minimalism" <br>
        - i liked browsing simple static websites from neocities,
        professors from my university, or old music critics like scaruffi and christgau <br>
        - nowadays my phone is in grayscale and i have eink devices, so having a website that looks similar
        on those devices is pretty cool
        - im not really good at expressing myself anyways
